# Magma-Federation-Gateway
The federated gateway provides remote procedure call (GRPC) based interfaces to standard 3GPP components, such as HSS (S6a, SWx), OCS (Gy), and PCRF (Gx). The exposed RPC interface provides versioning & backward compatibility, security (HTTP2 & TLS) as well as support for multiple programming languages. The Remote Procedures below provide simple, extensible, multi-language interfaces based on GRPC which allow developers to avoid dealing with the complexities of 3GPP protocols. Implementing these RPC interfaces allows networks running on Magma to integrate with traditional 3GPP core components.
